之前已经有文章指出ChatGPT对于语言学习帮助强大，相当于一个私教。我试着在一些例子里用了一下，效果确实非常让人惊讶，它不仅在释义和翻译上准确，对于文化背景能进行解释，它对于隐晦的幽默、讽刺等情感也能进行推断。这篇文章原本是用英文进行提问，附加的中文也是用GPT自动翻译的。


## 单词释义

谷歌翻译对下面这个例子中的Tory和round两个单词都翻译错误，Tory被翻译成了托利党，round被翻成肩膀变圆了，而GPT识别出了Tory是一个保守党成员，而它也准确解释出了round是形容久坐驼背后的肩膀。

```
remember this passage:

The Tory was waiting when Silas entered the private room.

He stood as if looking out the window, though it was covered by drapes. No prying eyes wanted. His back was to the door, and Silas gave himself a moment to look. Curly black hair that he knew to be shot with silver at the temples. A pair of shoulders beginning to round, just a little, from too long spent at a desk. Fawn breeches that didn’t hug his arse nearly as much as they might. A rich man, by Silas’s standards. Probably an important man. An unknown man.

He turned a moment after Silas entered, though he must have heard the door. Dark eyes under the black hair. Welsh blood at work, that was, that and the strong, dark features.

记住这一段：

当Silas进入私人房间时，托利正在等待他。他仿佛是在窗外看着，虽然窗户被窗帘遮住了，没有人会偷看。他背对着门，Silas给了自己一点时间看。卷曲的黑发，带有银色的太阳穴。肩膀微微耸起，可能是因为长时间坐在桌前。米色的马裤并没有紧紧贴着他的屁股。按照席拉斯的标准，他是一个富有的人。也许是一个重要的人物。一个不为人知的人物。

Silas进入房间后片刻，他转身了，尽管他一定听到了门声。黑发下的深色眼睛。威尔士的血液起了作用，那浓郁的黑色面容也是。
```

```
what does Tory mean in this passage? the story happens around 1820. 
```

```
In this passage, "Tory" likely refers to a member or supporter of the British Conservative Party, which was founded in the early 19th century and had significant influence in British politics during the 1800s. It is possible that the Tory in this passage is a political figure or someone with ties to the Conservative Party.

在这段文字中，“Tory”很可能指的是英国保守党的成员或支持者。保守党于19世纪初成立，在19世纪期间对英国政治产生了重大影响。在这段文字中，Tory可能是一个政治人物或与保守党有关系的人。
```

```
what does "round" mean?
```

```
In the context of the sentence "A pair of shoulders beginning to round, just a little, from too long spent at a desk," "round" means that the man's shoulders are becoming more curved or hunched due to prolonged periods of sitting at a desk.

在句子中的上下文中，“round”意味着这个人的肩膀由于长时间坐在桌子前而逐渐变得更加弯曲或驼背。
```


## 历史背景

这个选段发生在19世纪末的美国金银本位之争，GPT自动补全了文化背景和文中提及的相关法案。


```
translate this passage into simple chinese:

“We’re doing our best to keep this country from
bankruptcy, Mr. Gardiner. If gold is asked for, gold must be paid
out or we won’t maintain parity.”
“If you keep paying in gold, you’re going to run
out. A panic, either way.” Darrow resumed walking and Strickland
fell in beside him. “Abandoning silver is a drastic step.”
“We’re not abandoning silver.”
“The president wants to.”
“Repealing the Sherman law will protect the gold
reserve.” Strickland’s expression was as grave as Darrow had ever
seen it. “You have to admit it would be challenging to maintain a
gold standard if we haven’t got any.”
“Well, maybe you and your friends at the Treasury
should stop leaning so damned hard for a gold basis. Give silver a
fair chance—”
“Let me guess. Free coinage?” Strickland snorted in
exasperation. “I can’t imagine why you’d fancy dropping the value
of every dollar when you put so much effort into creating
them.”
```

```
我们正在尽最大努力防止这个国家破产，Gardiner先生。如果要求黄金，就必须支付黄金，否则我们就无法保持平价。”

“如果你一直支付黄金，你会用光的。不管哪种方式，都会引发恐慌。” Darrow恢复了行走，Strickland跟在他身旁。“放弃白银是一个激烈的步骤。”

“我们没有放弃白银。”

“总统想放弃白银。”

“废除Sherman法案将保护黄金储备。” Strickland的表情像Darrow以往从未见过的那么严肃。“你必须承认，如果我们没有黄金，维护金本位将是具有挑战性的。”

“好吧，也许你和财政部的朋友们不应该过于倾向于金本位。给白银一个公平的机会。”

“让我猜猜。自由铸币？” Strickland愤怒地哼了一声。“我无法想象，为什么你会想要在你投入这么多精力创建美元时降低美元的价值。”
```




```
explain the above passge
```


```
The passage is a conversation between two individuals, Darrow and Strickland, who are discussing monetary policy and the gold standard in the United States. Strickland expresses concern about maintaining parity and the need to pay out gold when requested to prevent the country from going bankrupt. Darrow points out that continuing to pay out gold could lead to a panic, and suggests that abandoning silver is a drastic step. Strickland responds by saying that they are not abandoning silver and that repealing the Sherman law will protect the gold reserve.

The conversation then turns to a debate about the merits of a gold versus silver standard. Darrow suggests that they should give silver a fair chance, but Strickland is skeptical of free coinage, which would decrease the value of the dollar. The Sherman law referred to in the conversation is likely the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which required the government to purchase a large amount of silver and issue paper currency based on that silver. The law was controversial and ultimately repealed in 1893, with many arguing that it contributed to the Panic of 1893 and the subsequent economic depression.

这段话是两个人，Darrow和Strickland之间的对话，他们讨论美国的货币政策和金本位制度。Strickland表达了对维持平价和在需要时支付黄金以防止国家破产的担忧。Darrow指出，继续支付黄金可能引发恐慌，并建议放弃银币是一个激进的举措。Strickland回应说他们并没有放弃银币，废除谢尔曼法案将保护黄金储备。

随后，对话转向了金本位和银本位的利弊辩论。Darrow建议给予银币一个公平的机会，但Strickland对自由铸币持怀疑态度，因为那会降低美元的价值。对话中提到的谢尔曼法案可能是1890年的谢尔曼白银购买法案，该法案要求政府购买大量的白银，并以该白银发行纸币。该法案引发了争议，并在1893年被废除，许多人认为它为1893年的恐慌和随后的经济衰退做出了贡献。

## 幽默推断

下面这个例子是最让我惊讶的，它显示出GPT强大的情感推断能力。文中作为律师的男一认为自己的早餐麦片是fungible (可替换的)，流行明星的男二不认识fungible这个单词，以为它是fungi (霉菌)的形容词，因此对男一说他不应该食用这份早餐。一开始GPT无法辨别这个选段的笑点所在，但在加上两个男主职业的提示后，它成功推断出男二听不懂fungible这个单词并联想到fungi


```
explain this conversation and why it is funny. Oliver is a lawyer, while the other character is a pop star.

“So it’s cold porridge?”

“A lot lighter and fresher—but substantial enough to keep me going through a court case. Also 

I can make it at the start of the week and it sees me through until Saturday, which is convenient.”

I was smiling helplessly at him. “Do you put little labels on the jars so you know which is for which day?”

“No.” He gave me a stern look that, somehow, wasn’t stern at all. “Bircher is fungible.”

“Well, if it goes fungible, you probably shouldn’t eat it.”

He laughed, somewhat indulgently. But, hey, I could get used to being indulged—especially by Oliver.”

“那这就是冷燕麦粥？”

“更清爽更新鲜，但足够让我在开庭时保持饱足感。而且我可以在一周开始时制作，一直吃到周六，很方便。”

我无助地笑了起来。“你会在罐子上贴标签，以便知道哪个罐子是哪一天的吗？”

“不会。”他给了我一种严肃的表情，但不知怎么回事，这并不严肃。“伯彻尔（Bircher）是可以互换的。”

“那么，如果它发生互换(长霉了)，你可能就不应该吃了。”

他笑了起来，有些纵容的笑声。但是，嘿，我可以习惯被Oliver纵容的感觉。”
```



```
In this conversation, Oliver is telling the other character about his breakfast, which is cold porridge called Bircher. The other character asks if he labels the jars to know which is for which day, and Oliver responds with "Bircher is fungible." The other character then jokes that if it goes fungible, he shouldn't eat it.

The humor in this conversation comes from the fact that the other character, being a pop star and not a lawyer like Oliver, doesn't know what "fungible" means. Oliver uses the term to mean that his breakfast is interchangeable or replaceable, but the other character takes it to mean that it has fungi or mold. This miscommunication leads to a humorous exchange between the two characters.

在这段对话中，Oliver正在告诉另一个角色他的早餐是冷燕麦粥，叫做Bircher。另一个角色问他是否标记罐子以区分每天的食物，Oliver回答说“Bircher是可替代的（fungible）”。然后另一个角色开玩笑说如果它变成可替代的，他就不应该吃它。

这段对话中的幽默来自于另一个角色，他是一位流行歌手，而不是像Oliver一样是律师，不知道“fungible”是什么意思。Oliver使用这个词来表示他的早餐是可以互换或替代的，但是另一个角色误解为它有真菌或霉菌。这种误解导致了两个角色之间的幽默交流。
```


又比如这个例子，GPT通过吃泥土的比喻识别出了老板对下属咖啡的厌恶情感：


```
explain this excerpt. "I" am a boss and "you" are my secretary.

“When I was a small boy, I liked to eat soil. My mother
worried, but she needn’t have been concerned. Unbeknown to both of us, I was
actually just preparing myself to drink your coffee.”

解释这段摘录。"我"是老板，"你"是我的秘书。

“当我还是个小男孩时，我喜欢吃土。我妈妈很担心，但她其实不必担心。我们两个都不知道的是，我实际上只是在准备喝你的咖啡。”
```



```
This excerpt is likely intended to be humorous and plays on the idea that the boss dislikes the secretary's coffee. The boss's statement that he used to eat soil is a strange admission, but he then uses it to suggest that the secretary's coffee is so bad that it makes him long for the taste of soil. The implication is that the coffee is so unpalatable that it is worse than eating dirt, which is obviously not a desirable taste. The contrast between the bizarre childhood behavior and the criticism of the secretary's coffee is meant to create a humorous contrast and add levity to the situation between the boss and the secretary.

这段摘录可能旨在幽默地展现出老板不喜欢秘书的咖啡。老板说他小时候喜欢吃土是一个奇怪的承认，但他接着用这个来暗示秘书的咖啡糟糕到让他渴望土的味道。这意味着咖啡的味道如此糟糕，比吃土还要难以下咽，而吃土显然不是什么可取的味道。这段描述通过奇怪的童年行为和对秘书咖啡的批评之间的对比来创造幽默的对比，增添老板和秘书之间的轻松氛围。
```


## 文化/语言背景

这个例子让GPT推断主角误认奖项是犹太奖项的原因 (奖项名是Wildenstein)，还有他被看出是通讯录的原因 (他在大白天穿着和服)。这两个原因都不包含明显的因果关系，但GPT还是推断出来了。

```
why did Less think the award is for Jews? How did people know he was gay?

“Arthur Less was up for a prize only once before: something called the Wilde and Stein Literary Laurels. He was informed of the mysterious honor through his agent, Peter Hunt. Less, perhaps hearing “Wildenstein,” replied he wasn’t Jewish. Peter coughed and said: “I believe it is something gay.” It was, and yet Less was surprised; he had spent half a lifetime living with a writer whose sexuality was never mentioned, much less his half life as a married man. To be called a gay writer! Robert scorned the idea; it was like elevating the importance of his childhood in Westchester, Connecticut. “I don’t write about Westchester,” he would say. “I don’t think about Westchester. I’m not a Westchester poet”—which would have surprised Westchester, whose council had placed a plaque on the middle school Robert had attended. Gay, black, Jewish; Robert and his friends thought they were beyond all that. So Less was surprised to know this kind of award even existed. His first response to Peter was to ask: “How did they even know I was gay?” He asked this from his front porch, wearing a kimono. But Peter persuaded him to attend.”

为什么Less认为这个奖项是给犹太人的？人们是如何知道他是同性恋的？

亚瑟·莱斯以前只有一次被提名奖项：那是一个叫做“王尔德和斯坦文学桂冠奖”的东西。他是通过他的经纪人彼得·亨特得知这个神秘的荣誉。莱斯或许听成了“威登斯坦”，回答说他不是犹太人。彼得咳嗽了一声说：“我相信这是与同性恋有关的什么东西。”确实如此，然而莱斯感到惊讶；他与一位性取向从未提及过的作家一起生活了半辈子，更不用说他作为已婚人士的一半生活了。被称为同性恋作家！罗伯特嗤之以鼻，他认为这就像抬高他在康涅狄格州韦斯特彻斯特的童年的重要性一样。“我不写关于韦斯特彻斯特的东西，”他会说。“我不思考韦斯特彻斯特。我不是一个韦斯特彻斯特的诗人。”这会让韦斯特彻斯特感到惊讶，他们的市政会还在罗伯特曾经就读过的中学放置了一块铭牌。同性恋、黑人、犹太人；罗伯特和他的朋友们认为他们已经超越了这一切。所以莱斯很惊讶得知这种奖项居然存在。他对彼得的第一反应是问道：“他们怎么知道我是同性恋的？”他穿着和服站在前廊上问这个问题。但彼得说服他去参加。
```



```
Less thought the award was for Jews because he misheard the name "Wilde and Stein Literary Laurels" as "Wildenstein," which sounds similar to the Jewish last name. However, his agent informed him that it was actually an award for gay writers.

As for how people knew Less was gay, it is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, it can be inferred that he was open about his sexuality to his agent and possibly others in the literary world. Additionally, the fact that he was wearing a kimono on his front porch suggests that he may have been more comfortable expressing his sexuality in his personal life.

雷斯以为这个奖项是给犹太人的，因为他听错了“Wilde and Stein Literary Laurels”为“Wildenstein”，后者听起来类似于犹太姓氏。然而，他的经纪人告诉他这实际上是一个给同性恋作家的奖项。

至于人们如何知道雷斯是同性恋，在这段中没有明确说明。然而，可以推断他对经纪人和可能是文学界的其他人坦诚了自己的性取向。此外，他在前廊穿和服的事实表明他在个人生活中可能更舒适地表达自己的性取向。
```


另一个Richard和Dick人名互换的的例子，GPT还给出了其他例子：


```
The story involves a character named Richard, but why does someone later call him Dick?
```


```
The use of the name "Dick" for the character Richard could be a play on the common nickname derived from the name Richard. "Dick" is a traditional nickname for Richard, much like "Rob" is for Robert or "Bill" is for William. It is possible that someone in the story uses "Dick" as a casual or familiar form of address, possibly to create a more relaxed or informal atmosphere. This kind of nickname can sometimes reflect the characters' personal relationships and the level of familiarity or intimacy they share. It may also serve to add a touch of humor or playfulness to the narrative.

对角色Richard使用"Dick"这个名字可能是对Richard常见昵称的玩笑。"Dick"是Richard的传统昵称，就像"Rob"是Robert或"Bill"是William一样。故事中的某人可能使用"Dick"作为一种随意或亲密的称呼形式，可能是为了营造更轻松或不正式的氛围。这种昵称有时可以反映角色之间的个人关系以及他们的熟悉程度或亲密度。它也可能为叙述增添一丝幽默或俏皮的色彩。

## 文本分析

下面的选段出自《傲偏》的现代改编，GPT识别出了4种设定上的平行：

```
This excerpt is from a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice. Analyze its connection with P & P. 

“WELL BEFORE HIS arrival in Cincinnati, everyone knew that Chip Bingley was looking for a wife. Two years earlier, Chip—graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Medical School, scion of the Pennsylvania Bingleys, who in the twentieth century had made their fortune in plumbing fixtures—had, ostensibly with some reluctance, appeared on the juggernaut reality-television show Eligible. Over the course of eight weeks in the fall of 2011, twenty-five single women had lived together in a mansion in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and vied for Chip’s heart: accompanying him on dates to play blackjack in Las Vegas and taste wine at vineyards in Napa Valley, fighting with and besmirching one another in and out of his presence. At the end of each episode, every woman received either a kiss on the lips from him, which meant she would continue to compete, or a kiss on the cheek, which meant she had to return home immediately. In the final episode, with only two women remaining—Kara, a wide-eyed, blond-ringleted twenty-three-year-old former college cheerleader turned second-grade teacher from Jackson, Mississippi, and Marcy, a duplicitous yet alluring brunette twenty-eight-year-old dental hygienist from “from Morristown, New Jersey—Chip wept profusely and declined to propose marriage to either. They both were extraordinary, he declared, stunning and intelligent and sophisticated, but toward neither did he feel what he termed “a soul connection.” In compliance with FCC regulations, Marcy’s subsequent tirade consisted primarily of bleeped-out words that nevertheless did little to conceal her rage.

“It’s not because he was on that silly show that I want him to meet our girls,” Mrs. Bennet told her husband over breakfast on a morning in late June. The Bennets lived on Grandin Road, in a sprawling eight-bedroom Tudor in Cincinnati’s Hyde Park neighborhood. “I never even saw it. But he went to Harvard Medical School, you know.”

“So you’ve mentioned,” said Mr. Bennet.”

这段摘录来自《傲慢与偏见》的现代改编版本。分析它与《傲慢与偏见》之间的联系。

“在他抵达辛辛那提之前，所有人都知道奇普·宾利在找妻子。两年前，奇普——达特茅斯学院和哈佛医学院的毕业生，宾夫人家族的后裔，在20世纪通过卫浴装置业积累了财富——他有些勉强地参加了名为《合格的对象》的真人秀节目。在2011年秋季的八个星期里，有二十五位单身女性在加利福尼亚州兰乔库卡蒙加的一座豪宅里一起生活，争夺奇普的芳心：陪他去拉斯维加斯玩二十一点，在纳帕谷的葡萄园品尝葡萄酒，在他面前争吵和诽谤对方。每一集的最后，每个女人要么收到他的亲吻，意味着她可以继续竞争，要么收到他的亲吻在脸颊上，意味着她必须立刻回家。在最后一集中，只剩下两位女性——卡拉，一个目光灿烂、金色卷发的23岁前职大学啦啦队员，现在是密西西比州杰克逊市二年级教师，和玛西，一个具有欺骗性但迷人的28岁布鲁内特人，来自“新泽西州莫里斯敦”的牙科卫生师——奇普痛哭流涕，并拒绝向任何一位求婚。他宣称她们都非凡，令人惊艳、聪明和复杂，但他对她们都没有所谓的“灵魂的连接”。根据FCC规定，玛西随后发表的愤怒言论主要被屏蔽了，但这些屏蔽并未能很好地掩盖她的愤怒情绪。”

“并不是因为他上了那个愚蠢的节目，我才希望他见我们的女儿们，”班纳特夫人在六月末的一个早晨，在早餐时告诉她的丈夫。班纳特一家住在辛辛那提海德公园地区的格兰丁路上，那是一座宽敞的、有八间卧室的都铎式建筑。 “我甚至从未看过那个节目。但他毕业于哈佛医学院，你知道的。”

“你已经提到过了，”班纳特先生说道。
```




```
This excerpt from a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice establishes a connection with the original novel through several elements:

Characterization: The names of the characters, such as Chip Bingley and Mr. Bennet, directly correspond to their counterparts in Pride and Prejudice, namely Charles Bingley and Mr. Bennet. This establishes a connection between the characters and allows readers familiar with the original novel to draw parallels.

Marriage and romance: The theme of marriage and finding a suitable partner is central to both Pride and Prejudice and the modern retelling. In this excerpt, it is stated that Chip Bingley is looking for a wife, just as Charles Bingley seeks a wife in the original novel. The idea of contestants vying for Chip's heart on a reality television show mirrors the social interactions and courtship rituals depicted in Pride and Prejudice.

Social status and education: The mention of Chip's educational background, having graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Medical School, parallels the emphasis on social status and education in Pride and Prejudice. In the original novel, the characters' social standing and educational achievements play a significant role in their relationships and societal expectations.

Family dynamics: The interaction between Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Bennet reflects the dynamic between Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. Mrs. Bennet's desire for Chip to meet their daughters and her mention of his educational background echo Mrs. Bennet's focus on finding eligible suitors for her daughters in the original novel.

这段摘录来自《傲慢与偏见》的现代改编版本，通过几个要素与原著建立了联系：

人物刻画：人物的名字，如Chip Bingley和Mr. Bennet，直接对应于《傲慢与偏见》中的角色，即Charles Bingley和Mr. Bennet。这建立了角色之间的联系，使熟悉原著的读者可以进行类比。

婚姻与浪漫：寻找合适的伴侣和婚姻是《傲慢与偏见》和现代改编版本的核心主题。在这段摘录中，提到Chip Bingley正在寻找妻子，就像原著中的Charles Bingley寻找妻子一样。在现代改编中，参赛者争取Chip的芳心的情节，反映了《傲慢与偏见》中描绘的社交互动和求爱仪式。

社会地位和教育：提到Chip的教育背景，毕业于达特茅斯学院和哈佛医学院，类似于《傲慢与偏见》中对社会地位和教育的强调。在原著小说中，角色的社会地位和教育成就在他们的关系和社会期望中起着重要作用。

家庭动态：Mrs. Bennet和Mr. Bennet之间的互动反映了《傲慢与偏见》中Mrs. Bennet和Mr. Bennet之间的关系。Mrs. Bennet希望Chip见到她们的女儿，提到他的教育背景，呼应了原著中Mrs. Bennet专注于为女儿找到合适婚配者的关注点。
